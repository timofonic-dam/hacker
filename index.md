# [](#header-1)Welcome to Timofonic's Programming Adventure

This is a simple site using a simple framework. It's just a way to remind myself certain tasks and show it to others.

## [](#header-2)Purpose of this site

This simple site will serve as a personal presentation and a way to how my exercises and projects to my course teachers.


### [](#header-3)A little example

```java
/* Text coloring:
 * It shows some words in the colors as their meaning.
 * @author Timofonic
 */

package com.timofonic;

public class Colors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here

	String red = "\033[31m";
    String green = "\033[32m";
    String orange = "\033[33m";
    String blue = "\033[34m";
    String purple = "\033[35m";
    String white = "\033[37m";

    System.out.print(orange + "tangerine" + green + " herb");
    System.out.print(orange + " grasshopper" + red + " tomato");
    System.out.print(white + " sheets" + blue + " sky");
    System.out.print(purple + " Nazarene" + blue + " sea");
    }
}
```

More soon, I have lots of things to do.

Thanks for watching! ;)
